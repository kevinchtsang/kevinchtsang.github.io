I am a Teaching Fellow/Assistant Professor at the University of Edinburgh and part of the Data-Driven Innovation Talent team. Our team delivers master's degrees and short courses to train and upskill students and health and social care professionals in areas relating to data and digital technology. I lecture in R, Python, SQL, and data science.

I am also a consultant in medical research advising the development of clinical trials and digital technology.

I completed my PhD in Medical Informatics at the University of Edinburgh (2022) applying machine learning, data science, mHealth, and mathematics to asthma attack prediction. My research was funded by the [Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, University of Edinburgh College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine](https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/aukcar/about/people/former-phd-students/kevin-tsang). I hold a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics from the University of Warwick (2018) and an MSc in Computational Applied Mathematics from the University of Edinburgh (2019).
