I am a final year PhD student at University of Edinburgh applying machine learning, data science, mHealth, and mathematics to asthma attack prediction. My research is funded by the [Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research](https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/aukcar/about/people/current-phd-students/kevin-tsang)
