In this Notebook, I use XGBoost (a machine learning) model to predict the weekly sales at Walmart across different stores and departments.

My model achieved a mean absolute percentage error of 2.36% over 7 months of hold out data.

Data consists of 421570 records of weekly sales from stores spanning between "05-Feb-2010" to "26-Oct-2012". This comprises of 143 Weeks of sales data.

You can read more about the data and find all the data in the link below.
