The purpose of this study is to develop and explore the acceptability of an asthma self-management system using existing smart monitoring devices and use machine learning to identify predictors of asthma attacks.

Although asthma attacks can be few and far between, expecially serious attacks, any attack could turn out to be serious. When mobile-health (mHealth) is combined with tailored feedback, this can replace the burdensome task of daily monitoring, leading to a better level of care for patients and thus less asthma attacks and a peace of mind.
